# ChatGPT_2.0
Made ChatGPT-clone app using Js, Css, Json, etc. 
I have used Vercel for deploying Frontend (UI) and Render for deploying its Backend (server) along with ChatGPT API.

This web app includes the features:
1) Give exact answer to the queston that user has asked.
2) Has capacity to learn from the previous question by user.
3) You can ask alternate questions because it stores all the questions.
4) User can use it as its personal chatGPT 2.0.
5) The server will never be busy. 

As of September 23, 2023, my OpenAI API credits have expired for all my accounts. I used to switch API keys to keep the service running for as long as possible. Quality of responses from OpenAI may not be fetched in good manner.
